# Rainfall-in-India

I saw a dataset today. It's about 'Rainfall in India.' It has 19 columns. When I checked the columns, I found that the first column is about the area, like districts or metropolitan cities. There are 36 areas in total. The data is from 1901 -2015 .that's the second column for yaer from 1901 to 2015 From the third to the fourteenth column, it has the rainfall data for every month. In the next column, they've totaled everything and it called as the annual data. There are also columns for three-month periods: January to February, March to May, June to September, and October to December .all the data you saw is stored in millimeters in the CSV file, and it covers rainfall across India..What I  understood is that The annual rainfall calculation uses all the monthly data, making it a supervised and continuousÂ classification of dataset.
